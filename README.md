# spring-security-jwt
This app demonstrates the usage of JSON Web Token (JWT) in Spring Security for Authentication and Authorization. It makes use of [JJWT](https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt) library for creating and verifying JWT.

A summary of what JWT is can be found [here](https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt#overview).

Full RFC standard for JWT can be found [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519). The JWT [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) also very helpful.
